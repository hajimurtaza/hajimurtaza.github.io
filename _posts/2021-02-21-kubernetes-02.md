-   Node Processes:
    * Each Node has multiple pods on it. 
    * Each Node must have the following 3 processes installed on it:
 
      <pre class="tab"> 1. Container Runtime : Container technology like Docker or something
      <pre class="tab"> 2. Kubelet : Interacts with container and node. Assigns resources like compute and network to container from node.
      <pre class="tab"> 3. Kube Proxy: Forwards requests intelligently and makes sure services run in a performant manner.

- Master Processes:
    * Interactions in clusters are handled by Master Node.
    * Each master node will have the following 4 processes running on it:

      <pre class="tab"> 1. API Server: The only entrypoint into a cluster. Only accepts authenticated requests. 
        Any requested related to cluster has to pass through API Server. 
      <pre class="tab"> 2. Scheduler: Responsible for scheduling application pods. Recieves request from 
      API Server. Intelligently schedules pods on Nodes which have enough resources like RAM, CPU etc to run pod or components. 
      <pre class="tab"> 3. Controller Manager: 
      <pre class="tab"> 4. etcd:
