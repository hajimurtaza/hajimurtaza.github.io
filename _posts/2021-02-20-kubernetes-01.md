**Tracking my progress in series of blog posts**

### Setup: 

1. Install kubernetes 

    `choco install kubernetes-cli`

2. Installl minikube

    `choco install minikube`


### Concepts:
1. **Kubernetes :**  Orchestration software to deploy docker images/containerised applications


  - **Node :** Virtual Machine/Server consisting of pods.
  - **Pods :**  

![K8 Pod]({{site.url}}/assets/images/kubernetes-0-pods.png){:height="230px" align="right"}

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Abstraction over container. 

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Provides running environment for images to run.

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Should run only 1 application container inside each pod 

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Each Pod gets its own ip address and is ephemeral. New Ip address on re creation.

  - **Service :** Used to provide permanent IP address to pods. Independant of pod lifecycle. Which means if pod is restarted, service will assist in keeping it connected.
